        # You might need to set up environment variables for sensitive data
        # like session data or API keys if you were using them.
        # For whatsapp-web.js, the session is usually stored locally.
        # This will likely require a persistent storage solution or manual QR scan.
        # Consider using a self-hosted runner or a more advanced setup for production.
        # For now, this step will likely hang waiting for QR code scan.
        # A more robust solution would involve a headless browser setup with session persistence.
        # For demonstration, we'll just run it, but it won't connect without manual intervention.
        # This part needs further discussion with the user.
